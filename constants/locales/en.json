        "privacyPolicy": "# PRIVACY POLICY\n\n**Last Updated:** 10/12/2025\n\n## 1. Data Controller\n\n**EARTH'S DREAMS S.R.L.**\nStradela Carabus Nr. 15, Iasi, 700275, Romania\nCUI: 38752272 (J22/39/07.01.2019) | VAT ID: RO38752272\nData Protection Contact: info@earthsdreams.ro\n\n## 2. Introduction and Principles\n\nWelcome to Proactive Lab (\"the Application\"). Your privacy is our top priority. We recognize the sensitive nature of health data and are committed to protecting it in full compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR - EU 2016/679).\n\nThis policy describes how we treat your data, based on the principles of Privacy by Design and Data Minimization.\n\n## 3. Types of Data Processed\n\n### A. Data entered by the user (Special Categories of Data - Art. 9 GDPR):\nTo provide the service, the app processes data that you voluntarily provide, such as:\n*   **Personal and biometric data** (age, gender, height, weight).\n*   **Health-related data** (biomarkers, symptoms, medical notes, clinical history).\n*   **Visual documents** (photos of medical reports uploaded for OCR/AI analysis).\n\n### B. Technical Data (Collected automatically):\n*   Anonymized system logs and technical data strictly necessary for security, debugging, and app operation.\n*   We do not use advertising trackers or third-party profiling cookies for marketing purposes.\n\n### C. Payment and Subscription Data:\nThe Application offers in-app purchases or subscriptions. EARTH'S DREAMS S.R.L. does **NOT** collect, process, or store your financial data (credit card numbers, bank accounts).\n\nAll financial transactions are handled entirely by third parties: Apple (App Store) for iOS and Google (Play Store) for Android. We only receive an anonymous \"token\" from these providers confirming payment or subscription status (active/expired), without any reference to your financial identity.\n\n## 4. \"Zero-Knowledge\" Architecture and Place of Processing\n\nThe Application operates on a \"Local-First\" model:\n\n*   **Local Storage:** Your health and personal data are saved encrypted exclusively on your device's memory.\n*   **No Proprietary Cloud:** Earth's Dreams S.R.L. does **NOT** own, manage, or have access to a central database containing your health data. We developers cannot see, read, or retrieve your data.\n*   **Sovereignty:** In case of app deletion or device loss without backup (which is the user's responsibility), data is unrecoverable by us.\n\n## 5. Use of Artificial Intelligence and Data Transfer\n\nTo provide advanced analysis features, the Application uses Google Gemini APIs (provided by Google Cloud Platform).\n\n*   **Transmission Mode:** When you request an analysis, only the strictly necessary textual or numerical data (stripped of your name and surname, if possible) are sent encrypted (HTTPS/TLS) to Google servers.\n*   **Data Usage Terms:** We use Google services in \"Enterprise\" mode. Under Google Cloud's current terms, your data is **NOT** used to train Google's Artificial Intelligence models and is not persistently stored by their systems.\n*   **Role of Google:** Google acts as a Data Processor or Sub-processor for mere technical processing.\n\n## 6. Legal Basis for Processing\n\nThe processing of your health data takes place exclusively on the basis of your **Explicit Consent** (Art. 9.2.a GDPR), which you provide upon first launching the app and which is necessary for service provision. You can revoke consent at any time by deleting data or uninstalling the app.\n\n## 7. Rights of the Data Subject\n\nIn accordance with GDPR, you have the right to:\n*   Access your data (all already visible on your device).\n*   Rectify inaccurate data.\n*   Delete data (\"Right to be forgotten\"): You can fully delete your data using the \"Delete all data\" function in app settings or by uninstalling the application. Since we do not keep copies on our servers, this action is final.\n*   Limit processing or object to it.\n\n## 8. Minors\n\nThe Application is intended exclusively for users aged 18 or older. We do not knowingly collect data from minors. If we become aware of minors' data entered in the app, we invite parents to delete the app from the minor's device.\n\n## 9. Changes\n\nWe reserve the right to update this policy. Substantial changes will be notified via the app.",
        "termsOfService": "# TERMS OF SERVICE (TOS)\n\n**Last Updated:** 10/12/2025\n\n## 1. Acceptance of Terms\n\nBy downloading, installing, or using Proactive Lab (\"the Application\"), provided by EARTH'S DREAMS S.R.L. (\"the Company\"), the user agrees to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not accept these terms, do not use the Application.\n\n## 2. License to Use\n\nThe Company grants the user a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to use the Application exclusively for personal and non-commercial purposes, in accordance with these Terms. It is forbidden to decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, or attempt to derive the source code of the Application.\n\n## 3. Access Models, Subscriptions, and Payments\n\nThe Application adopts a \"Freemium\" model. Some basic features are free and always active. Advanced features (\"Premium\") are visible within the app but appear locked or blurred until the user completes the purchase.\n\n### A. Unlocking Methods:\nThe user can unlock Premium features through one of the following methods (depending on the offer active at the time of purchase):\n*   **Subscription:** Recurring payment (e.g., monthly or annual) with automatic renewal.\n*   **One-Time Purchase (Lifetime):** If available, a single payment granting lifetime access to Premium features, without expiration and without recurring fees.\n\n### B. Payment Management:\nAll purchases are managed through your Apple ID (iOS) or Google Play (Android) account. Payment will be charged to the payment method associated with your Store account upon confirmation.\n\n### C. Immediate Unlock (No Trial Period):\nUnless otherwise specifically indicated as a promotion on the Store, the Application does **NOT** provide free trial periods. Premium features unlock immediately after payment confirmation. The user can evaluate the utility of Premium functions by consulting descriptions and previews in the app before purchase.\n\n### D. Automatic Renewal (Subscriptions Only):\nIn the case of a recurring subscription, it renews automatically at the end of each billing period, unless auto-renewal is turned off in Store account settings at least 24 hours before expiration.\n\n### E. Cancellation and Termination:\n*   **For Subscriptions:** You can cancel auto-renewal at any time from your Apple or Google account settings. Termination will take effect at the end of the current billing period.\n*   **For One-Time Purchase:** This purchase is final and requires no termination as it generates no future charges.\n\n**Note:** Uninstalling the app does **NOT** automatically cancel an active subscription.\n\n### F.
